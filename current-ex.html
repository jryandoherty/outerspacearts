                <p>Emma cc Cook (b. 1989, Minneapolis, MN; lives and works in Los Angeles, CA) graduated with a BFA in painting from University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, and studied at the Angel Academy in Florence, Italy. Select residencies include New York School of the Arts at Vytacil, NY and Campos de Gutierrez in Medellin, Colombia. Cook is a recipient of the MSAB grant, the Carter Prize in Painting and the Gay M. Grossman Memorial Scholarship.</p>

                <p>Cook often combines dark paintings on canvas with abrupt insertions of walnut sticks, textural variations, and intriguing thematic ventures that are inspired by rural American West landscapes and the broad discourses surrounding identity, history, environment, and erasure. In Caterpillar, Cook emboldens her dark paintings with bulbous vibrant red color fields, highlighting the tension, violence, and beauty in this history. </p>

                <p><em>by <a href="mailto:zlewis@hippopress.com">Zachary Lewis</a></em></p>

                <p><em>Originally published in <a href="https://hippopress.com/category/art-theater/?fbclid=IwY2xjawHxRk1leHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHbDEw3MTMSnf3B38WGXSVuVLga5G5lsFR1gURyxTZkX7hJhmm8stqqnPCQ_aem_biv5XLHmRwGQAHivsX7svw" target="_blank">The Hippo</a>, January 2025.</em> </p>

<p>Outer Space Arts in Concord will be showing the work of Emma cc Cook and Em Kettner in a show titled "Caterpillar" until Saturday, Jan. 18. The gallery is open on Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.</p>

<p>Roger Buttles opened Outer Space Arts in 2023 and has an MFA in painting and drawing from the Art Institute of Chicago. He has worked in the gallery world in San Francisco, Chicago and New York City.
</p>

<p>"I just wanted something a little more intimate and quiet. People can sit and enjoy the work," Buttles said. He has his own art studio in a room across the hall from the gallery. The building itself was built in 1854 and was once the residence of Col. Benjamin Grover. Buttles likes to spark conversation with the art he chooses.</p>

<p>"I'm always pairing two artists together to create a dialogue between their work ... ," he said.
"These two artists, they didn't know each other before, but they knew each other's work, and they both loved it. Emma's a Los Angeles-based artist. She does all the paintings. And then Em is a sculptor who's in San Francisco. I actually went to grad school with Em. Thatâs what feels good to me, the most exciting thing about the gallery is promoting work that I love. I've collected both of these artists. A lot of the work that I show are artists who I've either collected or really do want to collect. I never feel like Iâm pushing things that I donât fully believe in," he said.</p>

<p>The gallery is a labor of love that gained inspiration from a former teacher.</p>

<p>"The original idea of opening Outer Space is actually based on one of my mentors from grad school, Michelle Grabner. She was the chair of the painting department at the Art Institute in Chicago when I was there. She lived in the suburbs of Chicago with her husband and three kids, and she converted her tool shed and little garage into an exhibition space."</p>

<p>His mentor untangled an art knot for Buttles. "I'd never seen anything like that before, and it struck a chord with me. It's been really interesting that art can be presented anywhere, in any space. She became very known for her curating, and she ended up curating a Whitney Biennial based on what she was doing in her tool shed and that is so inspiring." The Whitney Biennial is an exhibition held at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City.</p>

<p>But someone should not need to be in New York to experience art.</p>

<p>"I don't think that art and galleries should be an elitist exclusive thing," Buttles said. "It should be inclusionary. I love at the openings when people bring their kids and they're running around. I bring my daughters and my son, and ours are all young, obviously. I want them to be at the openings, because that's something I was never exposed to as a kid, I wasnât exposed to any art, so I want that exposure and education for them," he said.</p>

<p>Many of the artists who exhibit at Outer Space show in those big city galleries as well.</p>

<p>âEm, she's in a show at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts right now. She has a similar sculpture as this one in the show ...  There's like a gentleness and a specificity to her work that I love and you can see that in some of the ceramics on the wall. They're very specific scenes.â</p>

<p>As with most things in life, it is better in person, especially with Cook's work.
Outer Space holds about four exhibits a year; the next one will be in February or March.</p>

            <p>The red oval series marks a transition in Cook's painting â incrementally moving away from her monochromatic system, she introduces hovering graphic devices over the landscape. With latent pervasiveness, the round and oval forms halve the landscape into smaller and smaller parts denoting an interruption of the vanishing-point. These forms map framing systems into the vista of the monocultural farm, occluding her historic use of the narrative flotsam composed as vignettes. Reminiscent of Baldessari's dot painting, with his device of anonymity, Cook harkens to an amendment or indemnification of the original, acting as a thwarted investigation or a lingering specter, tethered like a balloon, caught over the horizon.</p>

    <p>Em Kettner (b. 1988, Philadelphia, PA) is an artist and writer based in Richmond, CA. Her installations feature sculptures, tapestries, and drawings that detail the ingenuity of people with disabilities. Her miniature work in Caterpillar is about the ties that bind us â bloodlines, companionship, and ever more sprawling webs of connectivity.</p>

    <p>Kettner's recent solo exhibitions include:Â 
      <em>Homebound</em> at FranÃ§ois Ghebaly Gallery (New York, NY),
      <em>Sick Joke</em> at Chapter NY (New York, NY),
      <em>Slow Poke</em> at FranÃ§ois Ghebaly Gallery (Los Angeles, CA),
      <em>Play the Fool</em> at Goldfinch (Chicago, IL)
    </p>

    <p>Her sculptures are currently on view in the exhibition, <em>Tender Loving Care: Contemporary Art from the Collection</em> at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, through July 2025.</p>

    <p>Em's work has been reviewed and published in Cultured Magazine, ArtForum, Art in America, Sculpture Magazine, Contemporary Art Review LA (CARLA), HyperAllergic, Institutional Model, and Sixty Inches From Center. In September of 2023, Fulcrum Arts published her interactive digital storybook, "Doctor, Doctor," an illustrated fever dream journey through history, myth, and patient-hood.</p>

    <p>Em earned her BFA from the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, and an MFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. She is represented by <a href="https://ghebaly.com/" target="_blank">FranÃ§ois Ghebaly Gallery</a> in Los Angeles and New York.</p>

                  <p>My miniature sculptures are about the ties that bind us â bloodlines, companionship, and ever more
                  sprawling webs of connectivity.</p>
                  <p>The small scale is a twist on votive objects, which were historically offered to deities as pleas for relief
                  from illness and disability. I love those animistic qualities and that kind of magical thinking. But rather
                  than wish away certain physical conditions, I want to celebrate the ways our bodies transform and
                  adapt to support one another. Many of the sculptures are interdependent at the material level: fragile
                  porcelain limbs are held together by woven bindings, and in turn, the clay serves as the armature for
                  its own protective cocoon.</p>
                  <p>This new series brings together a troupe of hoop-shaped hybrid beings: expectant parents, performers
                  practicing routines, and figures melting into their memories. These composite characters intertwine in
                  gestures that are sensual and assistive â many limbs making light work of lifting and loving. They
                  wear the flamboyant costumes of jesters to insist that nothing is too sacred to be comical, or to be
                  shared.</p>
