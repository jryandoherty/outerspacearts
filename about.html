      <p>Located in a historic 19th century residence in downtown Concord, NH, Outer Space is an artist-run exhibition venue founded in 2023 by its curator <a href="https://www.rogerbuttles.com" target="_blank">Roger Buttles</a> (MFA, School of the Art Institute of Chicago / AB, Harvard University).</p>

      <p>Operating both geographically and culturally outside of the central locales of the major urban art centers, Outer Spaceâ€™s mission is to present emerging and established artists to a wider audience for both in person viewing and through the internet and social media. Not seeking to represent artists, participate in art fairs, or join in a centralized commercial art scene, Outer Space seeks to create dialogues with and between artists who are interested in presenting their work in an alternative exhibition space, in dialogue with other like-minded artists.</p>

      <p>Toward this goal, Outer Space will mount several two person shows per year, hoping to examine the interplay between the selected artists' practices and work, and to engage the wider community. Many of these artists will have extensive exhibition histories at prominent and emerging galleries, and will have been collected by major museums and private collectors. Others will be promising, talented, yet less established; our goal is to help foster a path to more widespread recognition for them. In a wider sense, Outer Space seeks to connect artists from different locales, backgrounds, generations, and career points and aid them in growing their practices and expanding their networks.</p>
